# Safest-Pittsburgh-Neighborhood
Final project for CS 0010 â€” Big Ideas in Computing.  
We used various public datasets from the City of Pittsburgh to determine which neighborhood is the safest. Each person in our group was responsible for finding and analyzing one dataset, and the findings were then all compiled together for our conclusions.

## How to Use
1. Download the `Safest-Neighborhood.ipynb` file   
2. Upload the file to and use JupyterHub to run the notebook

## Other Files
Each file in the repository represtents one dataset that was evaluated to come to our final conclusion. You may read/run these individually if you would like, but the majority of the information within them is incorporated into our conclusive findings within the `Safest-Neighborhood.ipynb` file.
